Add a kwarg in main called "fittingstyle".  Let it be either
"leastsquares" or "mcmc".   If it's leastsquares, use the current
curve_fit least squares fitting routine.  If it's mcmc, I want you to
implement a new MCMC fitting routine using numpyro.  Run MCMC to
sample over the posterior probability distribution for the circular
and eccentricty models.
For priors, take period from 2/24 to 6/24 (2 to 6 hours), t0 uniform
from min to max time, K uniform from 0 to 6, eccentricity uniform from
0 to 1.
The MCMC fitting routine should similarly return something analogous
to popt_circ and pcov_circ.  Have it print some convergence
diagnostics too.

Ask any clarifying questions before implementing.
