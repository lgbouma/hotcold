* Intro
  * p1: variable stars teach us about circumstellar envts, & define phot CPVs
      - no __direct__ evidence for circumst mat
  * p2: separate studies of young FGKM stars have, for decades...
    * rosetta stone btwn two subfields
  * p3: in this study...

  -m dwarfs are uniquely important. & there seems to be a dramatic gap in our
        understanding of their circumstellar envts early in their lives.
  -understanding the physical origins of stellar variability has history...

  -introduce reader to CPVs + properties
  -argue against starspots forcefully (but qualitatively)
  -introduce cartoons of clumps vs prominence arcs
  -describe origin differences btwn two pictures
  -theoretical import of the corotation radius
  -despite theory, CPVs have been hard to discover + characterize. bc...
  -in this work, we do x


* Results
  ** keck/hires: emission beyond v/veq>1 (2-3 paragraphs)
  * keck/hires: absorption within v/veq<1
  * keck/hires: emission within v/veq<1
  * keck/hires: (no) other spec variability
      (?)No evidence for doppler shadows in the line profiles
  * photometric variability

* Discussion + Conclusions (4 para? 5?)
  * spot-only is no more.
  * macrophysics: star, disk, planet. 
  * mass estimate
  * role of B: comparison to, and need for, RMHD models
    * massive B star / jupiter cnxn
  * more wavelengths:
      Radio detection.   Relevance for B measurement.
      UV?  xray?
      need for jwst
  * microphysics: the (probable) need for dust
      W1,W2,W3 no dust evidence.
      W4 detection questionable based on WISE images.

* Methods
  * phot observations
  * spec observations
  * stellar properties
  * assocation membership

FIGURE PLAN

-f1: TIC 141146667 is a complex periodic variable.
  -Still: c1265-1268, s48, 2022-02-16 to 2022-02-17
  -Animated supporting: Movie of S41, S48, S75 TESS photometry, cycle-grouped
    (This should be fig1?  Will nicely show shape evolution.  e.g. the cycle-by-color)

-f2: Money movie plot.  Panel layout:
  -Still: index 0012.  t=3.1hr

DISCUSSION POINTS

No evidence for doppler shadows in the line profiles

Radio detection.

W1,W2,W3 no dust evidence.

W4 detection questionable based on WISE images.

Evolving shape of complex variability [["TIC 1411 is a complex periodic variable."]
  S14, S15, S21, S41, S48, and S75 data exist...
  S14+15 1800sec only.  Flatter.  But significant phase smearing.
  S21 1800sec only, three local min.
  S41 120sec, gorgeous, four local minima.
  S48 120sec, gorgeous, four or five local minima.
  S75 120sec, v good, HIRES near-simult, two maybe three local minima.
