FIGURE PLAN

-f1: TIC 141146667 is a complex periodic variable.
  -Still: c1265-1268, s48, 2022-02-16 to 2022-02-17
  -Animated supporting: Movie of S41, S48, S75 TESS photometry, cycle-grouped
    (This should be fig1?  Will nicely show shape evolution.  e.g. the cycle-by-color)

f2: Money movie plot.  Panel layout:
  -Still: index 0012.  t=3.1hr

SUPPLEMENTARY

The data are nearly but not exactly simultaneous
  (   TESS light curve spanning BTJD 3352 to 3362       )
  (Phase folded shape before)  (Phase folded shape after)

DISCUSSION POINTS

No evidence for doppler shadows in the line profiles

Radio detection.

W1,W2,W3 no dust evidence.

W4 detection questionable based on WISE images.

Evolving shape of complex variability [["TIC 1411 is a complex periodic variable."]
  S14, S15, S21, S41, S48, and S75 data exist...
  S14+15 1800sec only.  Flatter.  But significant phase smearing.
  S21 1800sec only, three local min.
  S41 120sec, gorgeous, four local minima.
  S48 120sec, gorgeous, four or five local minima.
  S75 120sec, v good, HIRES near-simult, two maybe three local minima.
