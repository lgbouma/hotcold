Title: A Plasma Torus Around a Young Low-Mass Star

Abstract:

Approximately one percent of red dwarfs younger than 100 million years
show structured, periodic optical light curves suggestive of transiting
clumps of opaque circumstellar material that corotate with the star
[1-4]. The composition, origin, and even the existence of this material
are uncertain. The main alternative hypothesis is that these stars are
explained by complex distributions of dark starspots or bright faculae
distributed across their surfaces [5]. Here, we present time-series
spectroscopy and photometry of a 40 million year old complex periodic
variable (CPV), TIC 141146667. The spectra show coherent sinusoidal
Balmer emission at up to four times the star's equatorial velocity,
demonstrating the presence of extended clumps of circumstellar plasma —
a plasma torus. These data rule out "starspot-only" and "dust-only"
origin scenarios for CPVs, instead supporting either a purely stellar
origin for the phenomenon or extrinsic scenarios involving long-lived
disks or outgassing rocky bodies capable of supplying sufficient gas.
Given that long-lived condensations of cool (10^4 K) plasma can persist
in the hot (10^6 K) coronae of stars with a wide range of masses [6-11],
these data support the idea that such condensations can become optically
thick around the lowest-mass stars, although the exact source of the
opacity remains unclear.

DISCUSSION POINTS

No evidence for doppler shadows in the line profiles

Radio detection.

W1,W2,W3 no dust evidence.

W4 detection questionable based on WISE images.

Evolving shape of complex variability [["TIC 1411 is a complex periodic variable."]
  S14, S15, S21, S41, S48, and S75 data exist...
  S14+15 1800sec only.  Flatter.  But significant phase smearing.
  S21 1800sec only, three local min.
  S41 120sec, gorgeous, four local minima.
  S48 120sec, gorgeous, four or five local minima.
  S75 120sec, v good, HIRES near-simult, two maybe three local minima.
